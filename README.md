## Starting out

  interactive browser tutorial that walks you through some of the commands
  without letting you get too lost

## Help
* [Avoid the escape key](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key): tips
  on how to avoid the pains of reaching for Escape, with links to instructions
  on repurposing your Caps Lock key in [OSX/Linux](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip166)
  or [Windows](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip75).
* [Vim Cheat Sheet](http://jrmiii.com/attachments/Vim.pdf) (there are at least a
  million of these, search for one that works for you)
* Need help with a command or option? Try `:help <command>` in vim. Press
  `Ctrl+]` to navigate to a link under your cursor in the help documents.
* Steal from whoever you can! You can find plenty of well-organized `.vimrc`
  files in a dotfiles repository on GitHub. [Here's mine](https://github.com/dpatti/dotfiles).
